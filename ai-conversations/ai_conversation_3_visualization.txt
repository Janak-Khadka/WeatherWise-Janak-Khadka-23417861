AI CONVERSATION 3: Data Visualization Design and Implementation
Date: 2024-10-05
Tool: ChatGPT
Purpose: Create professional weather visualizations

ME:
I need to create temperature and precipitation visualizations that are clear and professional. What are the best practices?

AI:
For weather visualizations, consider these best practices:

Temperature Visualization:

Use a gauge chart for current temperature

Show trend line for forecast temperatures

Use color coding (blue for cold, red for hot)

Include reference lines for temperature ranges

Precipitation Visualization:

Show current conditions as bar charts

Display precipitation probability as colored bars

Use gradient colors (green-yellow-red) for probability

Include value labels on all bars

General Principles:

Use consistent color schemes

Add clear titles and labels

Include grid lines for readability

Ensure proper aspect ratios

ME:
How should I structure the create_temperature_visualisation() and create_precipitation_visualisation() functions?

AI:
Both functions should:

Accept weather_data dict and output_type parameter

Return figure if output_type='figure', else display

Use subplots for multiple related visualizations

Include proper error handling

Follow matplotlib best practices

Structure them as:
