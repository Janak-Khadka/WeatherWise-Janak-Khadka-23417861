AI CONVERSATION 2: Weather Data Processing and Error Handling
Date: 2024-10-05
Tool: ChatGPT
Purpose: Implement robust weather data processing with error handling

ME:
I'm implementing get_weather_data() using fetch-my-weather. The package returns different formats and might return error strings. How should I handle this?

AI:
The fetch-my-weather package has specific error handling patterns:

1. It returns error messages as strings starting with "Error:"
2. You should check for this pattern before processing
3. Use the format="raw_json" parameter for consistent dictionary output
4. Implement fallback to sample data when errors occur

ME:
The weather data structure from fetch-my-weather is complex. How should I extract and standardize the current conditions and forecast?

AI:
The fetch-my-weather JSON structure has these key elements:

current_condition[0] - Current weather data

weather[] - Daily forecasts with hourly data

nearest_area[0] - Location information

You need to:

Extract current conditions from current_condition[0]

Process forecast from weather[] array

Handle missing fields with defaults

Convert to your standardized format

For forecasts, note that wttr.in provides 3-day forecasts maximum, so respect that limit.

IMPLEMENTATION:
Created _process_weather_data() function that extracts and standardizes the complex JSON structure. Added proper error checking and default values for missing fields.

LEARNINGS:

Complex JSON data processing

Error handling patterns for external APIs

Data standardization techniques
