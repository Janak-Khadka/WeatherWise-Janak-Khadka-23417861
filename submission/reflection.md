# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
What tools did you use (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? How did they help?

For this project, I mainly used ChatGPT and a bit of GitHub Copilot for coding parts.

ChatGPT was my go-to for brainstorming and structuring my thoughts. When I felt stuck on how to explain a complex weather pattern in simple terms, I'd ask it to "explain like I'm 10," which gave me a great starting point that I could then refine. It was like having a patient, knowledgeable brainstorming buddy who never got tired of my questions.

GitHub Copilot was a huge help with the data analysis script. It saved me a ton of time on repetitive coding tasks, like writing out standard data visualization functions. It felt like having a pair programmer who could anticipate the boring parts of the code.

## Prompting Techniques
Which intentional prompting strategies did you apply?

I quickly learned that vague questions got me vague answers. The most effective strategy I used was the "Persona Prompt." Instead of just asking for information, I'd frame it like:

"Act as an expert meteorologist and a clear, engaging science communicator. Explain the difference between a weather watch and a warning for a general audience, using a simple analogy."

This one technique completely changed the quality of the output. The AI stopped giving me dry, textbook definitions and started giving me usable, human-friendly explanations that I could directly adapt for my project.

## What Worked Well?
Describe one thing you’re proud of.

I'm really proud of the narrative flow I managed to create in the final report. Instead of it just being a collection of facts and figures, I used AI to help me weave the data into a story—starting with the initial forecast, moving through the analysis of the unexpected temperature shift, and ending with the key takeaways. It made the whole thing feel more cohesive and, frankly, more interesting to read (and to write!).

## What Would You Do Differently?
Describe one thing you'd change if you had more time.

If I had more time, I would have experimented with more niche AI tools. I relied heavily on ChatGPT, but I heard about tools like Midjourney or DALL-E that could have generated custom weather maps or infographics to make my presentation even more visually compelling. Next time, I’d dedicate a few hours just to testing out a new, specialized tool to level up the project's polish.

## Final Thoughts
Any parting comments on your learning experience?

This project was a real "aha!" moment for me. It shifted my view of AI from a fancy search engine to a true collaboration tool. The key takeaway was that my own critical thinking and editing skills became even more important. The AI generated the clay, but I was the one sculpting it into something meaningful. It was less about the AI doing the work for me, and more about it helping me do my work better and faster. A really valuable learning experience!
